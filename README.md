# Tabletop Dice Roller for Android 
- What is this?
Long story short, roleplaying dice have always been the bane of my existence. I almost choked on one when I was a kid, I keep losing them and hear this out,
during a session of roleplaying in discord, my cat jumped on the lid of my laptop, closed it shut when some dice were on the keyboard so the display broke. 

## THAT'LL BE NO MORE!!! 

I created this simple app with the sole goal of getting rid of any dice in question. 
This app can create up to 6 dice, with up to a 100 faces each! 

## WOW, THAT GUY AT THE TABLETOP SHOP WON'T RIP ME OFF ON EXPENSIVE DICE NO MORE!!

Yeah, TTG store guys hate this. No more losing dice, no more choking, no more silly accidents. 

# In all seriousness now 

I created this app to have a head start into masteting Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. 
That's all it used. Feel free to ask questions. I won't likely answer them but go on, fill my
email with shit:  gabrielnr93@gmail.com 

## Any future features? 

I was wondering. what could be good? 
- Personalized dice for people playing other games that require specific dice? Like
"Dead of Winter" or "Cyberpunk 2077: The Tabletop Game". Definitively working on it. 
- The ability to throw a certain amount of dice instead of only one or all of them at once? Working on it too! 
- iOS port? More likely than you think. 
- Will this be on the App Store or Google Play? I dont know... maybe in a future. 
- Will you make a web version of this? Maybe, as a fun little side project. 
- Will you sell me this repo? Hmmm... no... 
- Can I fork this? Yeah, go on...
